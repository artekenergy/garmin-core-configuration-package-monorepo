/**
 * TypeScript type definitions exported from Zod schemas
 *
 * These types are automatically inferred from the Zod schemas,
 * ensuring runtime validation and compile-time types stay in sync.
 *
 * Note: Most types are now exported directly from their respective schema modules.
 * This file only contains validation result types and helper types.
